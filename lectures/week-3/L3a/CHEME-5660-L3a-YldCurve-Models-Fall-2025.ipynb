    "# L3a: Modeling and Analysis of Interest Rates\n",
    "Today, we will continue our discussion of United States Treasury Securities and introduce the term structure of interest rates, the Yield curve, and our first prediction model, the binomial lattice model of interest rates, which can be used to compute future (unknown) rates. \n",
    "\n",
    "After today's lecture, students should be able to define and demonstrate mastery of the following concepts:\n",
    "* The __term structure of interest rates__ refers to the relationship between interest rates on Treasury securities of different maturities. It reflects how the market perceives future economic conditions and expectations for inflation and growth. It is our first example of using the market to infer future conditions.\n",
    "* The __Yield curve__ is the time evolution of the interest rates for various maturity Treasury securities. In popular parlance, the yield curve is an _indicator_ computed as the interest rate on long-maturity instruments minus short-maturity instruments. It is used to predict future economic conditions, such as recessions or expansions.\n",
    "* A __binomial lattice model__ assumes that tomorrow can exist in one of two possible states: up or down. From today, we move to the up state with probability $p$ and the down state with probability $(1 - p)$. We'll use this type of model to _predict future interest rates_.\n",

    "> __Term structure of interest rates__ is the relationship between the _yields_ on fixed income debt securities of different maturities but similar credit quality, observed at a specific point in time. It typically illustrates how interest rates vary with the length of time until a bond's maturity.\n",
