    "# L3b: Market Inference of Future Interest Rates\n",
    "In this lecture we will continue our exploration of yield curves and the term-structure of interest rates. We will introduce a very interesting Treasury security called a STRIP (Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal of Securities) bond.\n",

    "> __Motivation__: We looked at the __par yield curve__ in the previous lecture. However, we were left with the question of how to compute the discount factors for all maturities in the par yield curve. Today, we'll show that these values can be observed in the market by looking at the price of a special zero coupon bond called a STRIP bond. This will allow us to compute the spot rate (discount rate at a point in time) curve for different maturities, from which we can compute the par yield curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lecture, you should be able to:\n",
    "* __STRIPS Bonds__: Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal of Securities (STRIPS) bonds are zero coupon bonds that are created by separating (stripping) the interest payments from the principal payment of a Treasury security. We will learn how to price STRIPS bonds and how they can be used to infer the spot rate curve from the par yield curve.\n",
    "* __Spot Rate Curve__: We will learn how to compute the spot rate curve from the par yield curve using STRIPS bonds. This will involve understanding how to price STRIPS bonds and how to use their prices to infer the spot rates for different maturities.\n",

    "## Concept Review\n",
    "The __yield curve__ is a graphical representation of the relationship between interest rates (or yields) and the time to maturity of debt securities. It is an important tool in finance and economics, as it provides insights into market expectations for future interest rates, inflation, and economic growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "The yield curve can take on different shapes, each of which can provide different insights into market expectations. The three most common shapes of the yield curve are:\n",
    "* __Normal Yield Curve__: A normal yield curve is upward sloping, indicating that longer-term debt securities have higher yields than shorter-term securities. This is typically seen in a healthy economy, where investors expect future interest rates to rise.\n",
    "* __Inverted Yield Curve__: An inverted yield curve is downward sloping, indicating that shorter-term debt securities have higher yields than longer-term securities. This is often seen as a sign of an impending recession, as investors expect future interest rates to fall.\n",
    "* __Flat Yield Curve__: A flat yield curve indicates that there is little difference in yields between short-term and long-term debt securities. This can indicate uncertainty in the market, as investors are unsure about future interest rates and economic growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "The yield curve is typically constructed by computing a hypothetical yield called the par yield for different maturities. The par yield is the yield at which a bond would trade at par value, meaning that the bond's price is equal to its face value. The par yield is given by:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\boxed{\\displaystyle \\bar c_{\\text{par}}(T) \n",
    "= n\\cdot\\frac{1 - \\mathcal{D}^{-1}_{nT,0}(\\bar r)}{\\sum_{j=1}^{nT}\\mathcal{D}^{-1}_{j,0}(\\bar r)}.}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $n$ is the number of coupon payments per year, $T$ is the time to maturity in years, $\\mathcal{D}^{-1}_{j,0}(\\bar r)$ is the (inverse) discount factor for the $j^{th}$ coupon payment, and $\\bar r$ is the __yield to maturity__ (YTM) of a zero coupon bond with maturity of $T$ years.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Today:__ Ok, so if $\\bar{r} = \\bar{Y}$, for different maturities, where do we get this number from? If this the yield to maturity for a hypothetical zero coupon bond, how do we compute it, especially for longer duration instruments (T-bills have a maximum length of only one year). \n",

    "STRIPS, short for [Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal of Securities](https://treasurydirect.gov/marketable-securities/strips/) bonds, offer investors a unique fixed-income investment opportunity to access the income and coupon payments of Treasury securities. STRIPS are components of a coupon-bearing Treasury instrument, such as a Treasury note or bond, that have been separated (or \"stripped\") into individual zero-coupon securities.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __How are STRIPS created?__ STRIPS are created by separating a Treasury security's coupon and principal components and trading them as zero-coupon securities. For a $T$ year Treasury note or bond, with $n$ coupon payments, there will be $nT+1$ STRIPS created: one for each coupon payment and one for the principal payment at maturity. A broker-dealer or financial institution will typically purchase a Treasury security, strip the coupons and principal, and then sell the individual STRIPS to investors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond their immediate value as investment tools, STRIPS are interesting as they provide another perspective on the [Term Structure of Interest Rates](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/termstructure.asp#:~:text=Essentially%2C%20term%20structure%20of%20interest,current%20state%20of%20an%20economy).
