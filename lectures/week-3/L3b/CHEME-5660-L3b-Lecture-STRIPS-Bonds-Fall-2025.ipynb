    "# L3b: Market Inference of Future Interest Rates\n",
    "In this lecture we will continue our exploration of yield curves and the term-structure of interest rates. We will introduce a very interesting Treasury security called a STRIP (Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal of Securities) bond.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Motivation__: We looked at the par yield curve in the previous lecture. However, we were left with the question of how to compute the spot rate curve from the par yield curve, i.e., we need a way to compute the current spot rates for all the maturities in the par yield curve. How do we do this?\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lecture, you should be able to:\n",
    "* __STRIPs Bonds__: Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal of Securities (STRIPs) bonds are zero coupon bonds that are created by separating (stripping) the interest payments from the principal payment of a Treasury security. We will learn how to price STRIPs bonds and how they can be used to infer the spot rate curve from the par yield curve.\n",
    "* __Spot Rate Curve__: We will learn how to compute the spot rate curve from the par yield curve using STRIPs bonds. This will involve understanding how to price STRIPs bonds and how to use their prices to infer the spot rates for different maturities.\n",
    "* __Short Rate Curve__: Short rates are the projected interest rate between two periods in the future. We will learn how to compute the short rate curve from the spot rate curve and how it relates to the par yield curve.\n",

    "STRIPS, short for [Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal of Securities](https://treasurydirect.gov/marketable-securities/strips/) bonds, offer investors a unique fixed-income investment opportunity to access the income and coupon payments of Treasury securities.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __How STRIPS created?__ STRIPS are created by separating a Treasury security’s coupon and principal components and trading them as zero-coupon securities. For a $T$ year Treasury note or bond, with $n$ coupon payments, there will be $nT+1$ STRIPs created: one for each coupon payment and one for the principal payment at maturity. A broker-dealer or financial institution will typically purchase a Treasury security, strip the coupons and principal, and then sell the individual STRIPS to investors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond their immediate value as investment tools, STRIPS are interesting as they provide another perspective on the [Term Structure of Interest Rates](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/termstructure.asp#:~:text=Essentially%2C%20term%20structure%20of%20interest,current%20state%20of%20an%20economy).

Because $\\theta_{1}>{0}$, $\\theta_{2}\\geq{0}$, and $\\beta>0$ this scheme will give a _normal_ yield curve $\\bar{r}_{i}\\leq\\bar{r}_{i+1}$, i.e., longer-term maturity will have a higher-yield compared to shorter-term bonds.\n",
