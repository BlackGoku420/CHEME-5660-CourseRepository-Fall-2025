    "# L2b: Malkiel's Bond Pricing Theorems\n",
    "In this lecture, we will explore Burton Malkiel's bond pricing theorems, which provide a framework for understanding the relationship between bond prices and interest rates. \n",
    "The concepts that students should be able to define and demonstrate mastery of from this lecture are:\n",
    "* __Malkiel's Bond Pricing Theorems__ Malkiel’s theorems formalize the key relationships between bond prices and yields (rates), showing how maturity, coupon level, and the nonlinear nature of discounting combine to govern price sensitivity. Together, they provide the foundation for understanding convexity, term‐structure effects, and the asymmetric impact of yield (rate) changes on fixed‐income securities.\n",
    "* __Derivation__ The derivation of Malkiel's bond pricing theorems involves understanding how bond prices change in response to changes in interest rates, taking into account the time value of money and the characteristics of the bond itself. This involves computing the _total differential_ of the bond price with respect to the yield (rate), coupon rate, and time to maturity, which captures how small changes in the parameters of the Treasury instrument affect the bond price.\n",
    "* __Can we show these theorems in auction data?__ The empirical validation of Malkiel's bond pricing theorems involves analyzing historical bond price movements in response to changes in interest rates, coupon rates, and time to maturity, confirming the theoretical predictions of the theorems through statistical analysis and regression techniques will help us understand how well these theorems hold in practice and whether they can be used to predict bond price movements accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you are a bond trader, and you have a portfolio of bonds that you need to manage. You know that interest rates are going to change, and you want to know how this will affect the value of your portfolio.  Malkiel's theorems are essential for managing interest rate risk in fixed-income portfolios. So let's get started!\n",

While the United States has never defaulted, many examples of countries in modern times have defaulted. For example, [Greece defaulted in 2011](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_government-debt_crisis) and [Russia defaulted in 1998](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998_Russian_financial_crisis). This makes borrowing more expensive (if not impossible) because the issuer has _poor credit_. For U.S. treasury securities, the default risk is __low__.\n",
    "* __Interest rate risk__: In this scenario, we (the debt holder) want to sell the security on the secondary market, i.e., to convert the debt security back into cash. However, because market conditions, i.e., interest rates, have changed since the debt was issued (or we purchased it), the note/bill/bond price may have changed. Thus, we could experience a realized capital loss (gain) when we sell the bill/note/bond. For U.S. treasury securities, the interest rate risk is __high__.\n",

    "Silicon Valley Bank collapsed in March 2023 after rising interest rates eroded the value of its long‐duration bond portfolio. When a sudden run on deposits by tech clients occurred, the rapid outflow of funds left the bank unable to meet liquidity needs, leading to its closure by regulators.\n",
    "* __What happened__? Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) invested heavily in long-duration U.S. government securities while interest rates were low. As the Federal Reserve raised rates in 2022–2023, the value of these bonds fell, leading to significant unrealized losses. In early March 2023, many uninsured tech-startup depositors withdrew funds. When SVB announced a capital raise to cover its realized bond losses, panic ensued, resulting in bank failure. \n",
    "* __What was the aftermath?__ The [Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)](https://www.fdic.gov) took control of SVB on March 10, 2023, marking the most significant bank failure since the 2008 financial crisis (second largest in U.S. history). To prevent a broader banking crisis, the U.S. government stepped in to protect all depositors, including those with uninsured balances. The [United States Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov) also introduced emergency lending facilities to provide liquidity to banks facing similar issues.\n",

    "__Bond Pricing and Interest Rate Sensitivity__: SVB's collapse illustrates the fundamental relationship between bond prices and interest rates - when rates rise, bond prices fall, and the magnitude of this price change depends on the bond's characteristics. \n",
    "> __Model__: The mathematical relationships governing this sensitivity were formalized by Burton Malkiel in his famous bond pricing theorems. These theorems explain why SVB's long-duration bonds experienced such dramatic price declines and provide quantitative tools for measuring and managing interest rate risk. Understanding these relationships is crucial for any institution holding fixed-income securities.\n",
