    "# L4b: Lattice Models for Equity Pricing\n",
    "Today, we will introduce lattice models of equity share prices. Weâ€™ll estimate the lattice parameters using data-driven and model-driven approaches. Finally, we explore whether a lattice model shows any of the stylized facts we find in market observations. \n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lecture, you will be able to define and demonstrate mastery of the following key concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A __binomial lattice model__ assumes that tomorrow exists in one of two possible states: up or down. From today, we move to the up-state with probability p and the down-state with probability (1 - p).\n",
    "* __Lattice model parameters__: There are two possible approaches for the lattice parameters. A real-world probability approach assumes we estimate parameters from data. A risk-neutral probability approach assumes a particular model for the lattice parameters.\n",
    "* __Stylized facts__: Stylized facts refer to empirical statistical properties of asset returns across various financial markets, such as heavy tails, volatility clustering, and the lack of autocorrelation. These serve as essential guidelines for developing and validating financial models.\n",
    "\n",
    "While lattice models are not the most sophisticated models available, they are easy to understand and implement, and are suprisingly effective in capturing the essential features of equity share prices. So, let's get started!\n",

    "## Bionomial Lattice Model\n",
    "A binomial lattice model is a discrete-time model used to represent the evolution of an asset's price over time. \n",
    "> __Binomial Lattice Model__: A binomial lattice model assumes that at each time step, the asset can either move up by a factor $u$ with a probability $p$ or down by a factor $d$ with probability $(1-p)$, creating a tree-like structure of possible future prices. At time $t\\geq{0}$ there will be $t+1$ possible prices. \n",
    "\n",
    "> __Key assumptions__: The probaility $p$, and the up and down factors are independent of the time step $t$, i.e., these parameters are constant across the lattice. The up, down and probability parameters are specific to each firm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a stock with an initial price $S_0$ at time $t=0$ (today). Assuming a binomial lattice model, at $t = 1$ (tomorrow), the stock can occupy the up state with a price $S^{(+)}_{1} = S_{0}\\;u$ with probability $p$ or the down state with price $S^{(-)}_{1} = S_{0}\\;d$ with probability $(1-p)$. The process continues for $n$ time steps, creating a binomial tree of possible prices.\n",

    "So where do we get the up and down factors $u$ and $d$, and the probability $p$? There are two approaches: a data-driven approach and a model-driven approach. Let's start with the data-driven approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Price Distribution\n",
    "The binomial lattice model gets its name because the prices at level $t$ can be represented as a binomial distribution. Let's see where this comes from. \n",
    "\n",
    "> __Key idea__: At each node of the lattice, we are performing a Bernoulli trial: we either move up with probability $p$ or down with probability $(1-p)$. Thus, we have a sequence of $t$ independent Bernoulli trials, where each trial has two possible outcomes: up or down. This sequence of trials can be represented as a binomial distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a path from the root ($t=0$) to any node at level $t$. This path consists of exactly $t$ moves, where each move is either up (U) or down (D). Let $k$ be the number of up moves and $(t-k)$ be the number of down moves. The price at any node with $k$ up moves and $(t-k)$ down moves is:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "S_{t,k} = S_0 \\cdot u^k \\cdot d^{t-k}\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\binom{t}{k} = \\frac{t!}{k!(t-k)!}$ is the binomial coefficient representing the number of ways to choose $k$ up moves from $t$ total moves.\n",
    "At level $t$ (e.g., $t$ days in the future), there are $(t+1)$ possible prices:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "S_{t,0} &= S_0 d^t &&\\text{(all down moves)} \\\\\n",

    "\n",
    "### Real World Parameter Estimation\n",

Later, we'll impose the constraint $ud = 1$, however, this condition is not necessary for recombination, though it may be imposed in some models for risk-neutral pricing or to ensure symmetric price movements.\n",
