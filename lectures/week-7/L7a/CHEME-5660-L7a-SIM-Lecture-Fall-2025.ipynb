    "# L7a: Introduction to Single Index Models (SIMs)\n",
    "In this lecture, we explore Single Index Models (SIMs) in the context of financial markets. SIMs are a simplified approach to modeling the relationship between a security's returns (growth rate) and the returns (growth rate) of a __market index__.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lecture, you will be able to define and demonstrate mastery of the following key concepts:\n",
    "* __Factor models__ describe the relationship between a security's returns and the returns of a market index, and other factors, such as interest rates, inflation, and economic growth, etc.\n",
    "* __Single Index Models (SIMs)__ are a type of factor model that simplifies the relationship between a security's returns and the returns of a market index by assuming that the security's returns are linearly related to the returns of the market index.\n",
    "* __Estimation and evaluation of SIM parameters__ involves estimating the parameters of the model, such as the alpha and beta coefficients, and evaluating the model's performance using statistical measures such as R-squared, and computing the stylized facts of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "While seemingly simple, SIMs are widely used in portfolio management and risk assessment, as they provide a straightforward way to understand the relationship between a security's returns and the market index. Further, they are a handy way to address the multiasset problem. So let's get started!\n",

    "## Factor models\n",
    "The idea underlying factor models is that the returns of a security can be explained by the returns of a market index, and other factors, such as interest rates, inflation, and economic growth, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose the growth of firm $i$ at time $t$ is denoted by $\\mu^{(t)}_{i}$. We can express the growth of firm $i$ at time $t$ as a linear function of the growth of a market index at time $t$, denoted by $\\mu^{(t)}_{M}$, and other factors, such as interest rates, inflation, and economic growth, etc, which we denotes as $\\left\\{f^{(t)}_{1}, f^{(t)}_{2}, \\ldots, f^{(t)}_{k}\\right\\}$:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mu^{(t)}_{i} = \\alpha_{i} + \\beta_{i}\\mu^{(t)}_{M} + \\sum_{j=1}^{k}\\gamma_{ij}f^{(t)}_{j} + \\epsilon^{(t)}_{i},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $\\alpha_{i}$ is the intercept term, $\\beta_{i}$ is the sensitivity of the security's returns to the market index, $\\gamma_{ij}$ is the sensitivity of the security's returns to the $j$-th factor, and $\\epsilon^{(t)}_{i}$ is the error term, which captures the idiosyncratic risk of the security.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: The Fama-French Three-Factor Model\n",
    "One of the most influential extensions of the single-factor approach is the Fama-French three-factor model. The development of this model began with Fama and French's empirical work in 1992 demonstrating the limitations of CAPM, followed by their formal introduction of the three-factor model in 1993:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Fama, E. F.; French, K. R. (1992). The Cross-Section of Expected Stock Returns. *The Journal of Finance*, 47(2), 427-465. doi:10.1111/j.1540-6261.1992.tb04398.x\n",
    "> \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Fama-French model has three specific factors: the market factor (similar to our market index $\\mu^{(t)}_{M}$), a size factor that captures the return difference between small-cap and large-cap stocks, and a value factor that captures the return difference between high book-to-market (value) and low book-to-market (growth) stocks. Mathematically, the model can be expressed as:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mu^{(t)}_{i} = \\alpha_{i} + \\beta_{i}\\mu^{(t)}_{M} + s_{i}\\;\\text{SMB}^{(t)} + h_{i}\\;\\text{HML}^{(t)} + \\epsilon^{(t)}_{i},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $\\text{SMB}^{(t)}$ represents the \"Small Minus Big\" factor (the return of small-cap stocks minus large-cap stocks at time $t$), $\\text{HML}^{(t)}$ represents the \"High Minus Low\" factor (the return of high book-to-market stocks minus low book-to-market stocks at time $t$), and $s_{i}$ and $h_{i}$ are the factor loadings that measure firm $i$'s sensitivity to the size and value factors, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "This three-factor structure has proven remarkably successful in explaining cross-sectional variation in stock returns. In their foundational 1992 study, Fama and French demonstrated that portfolios formed on size and book-to-market characteristics could explain over 90% of the variation in diversified portfolio returns, compared with the average 70% given by the CAPM. The model's success stems from its ability to capture fundamental economic relationships: smaller companies tend to be riskier and thus command higher expected returns, while value stocks (those with high book-to-market ratios) often represent distressed companies that also require higher expected returns to compensate investors for the additional risk.\n",

    "## Single Index Models (SIMs)\n",
    "Single index models are factor models that consider only the return (growth) of the market factor. These models were originaly developed by Sharpe, 1963: [Sharpe, William F. (1963). \"A Simplified Model for Portfolio Analysis\". Management Science, 9(2): 277-293. doi:10.1287/mnsc.9.2.277.](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.9.2.277)\n",

    "\n",
    "> __Aside: Return versus Growth?__\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Sharpe's original model used the return, and not the growth rate. What is the connection between the two models? Let's start from the original return model, and show how it relates to the growth model. The original model is given by:\n",
    "> $$\n",
    "> \\begin{align*}\n",

    "> However, we know that the growth rate are the return are related:  $r^{(t)}_{i} = \\mu^{(t)}_{i}\\;\\Delta{t}$. Thus, we can rewrite the original model as:\n",
    "> $$\n",
    "> \\begin{align*}\n",
    "> \\overbrace{\\mu^{(t)}_{i}\\;\\Delta{t}}^{r^{(t)}_{i}} &= \\bar{\\alpha}_{i} + \\bar{\\beta}_{i}\\;(\\overbrace{\\mu^{(t)}_{M}\\;\\Delta{t}}^{r^{(t)}_{M}}) + \\bar{\\epsilon}^{(t)}_{i}\\quad\\Longrightarrow\\text{Divide by }\\;\\Delta{t}\\\\\n",
    "> \\mu^{(t)}_{i} &= \\underbrace{\\frac{\\bar{\\alpha}_{i}}{\\Delta{t}}}_{\\alpha_{i}} + {\\bar{\\beta}_{i}}\\;\\mu^{(t)}_{M} + \\underbrace{\\frac{\\bar{\\epsilon}^{(t)}_{i}}{\\Delta{t}}}_{\\epsilon^{(t)}_{i}}\\\\\n",

    "> \\end{align*}\n",
    "> $$\n",
    "> Thus, the two models have the same form, but the $\\alpha_{i}$ parameter, and the error models are divided by the time step $\\Delta{t}$. Lastly, in practice, we drop the overbar on $\\beta_{i}$, which gives the growth rate SIM:\n",

    "> By default, we'll use the growth model, but you should be aware of the original return model, and how it relates to the growth model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What do the $(\\alpha_{i}, \\beta_{i})$ parameters mean?\n",
    "The parameters of the single index model have some interesting interpretations.\n",

A higher $\\beta_{i}$ indicates that the growth rate of firm $i$ is more sensitive to changes in the market index, and thus, it is more risky. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's dig into the meaning of the $\\beta_{i}$ parameter a little more, starting with the growth interpretation. We can rearrance the SIM as:\n",

    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where we used the fact that $\\alpha_{i}$ is a constant (variance is zero), $\\beta_{i}$ is a constant that can be factored out of the variance, and we assume that the error term $\\epsilon^{(t)}_{i}$ is uncorrelated with the market growth $\\mu^{(t)}_{M}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "> __Risk__: The total risk of firm $i$ (measured by $\\sigma_{i}^{2}$) consists of two components:  __Systematic risk__: $\\beta_{i}^{2}\\;\\sigma_{M}^{2}$ and __Idiosyncratic risk__: $\\sigma_{\\epsilon,i}^{2}$.\n",
